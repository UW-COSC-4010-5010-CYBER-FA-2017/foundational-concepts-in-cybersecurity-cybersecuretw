minimization example: In this program, we have a simple hello world program. It is minimized in size, meaning there is much less code to secure, making it more secure. 

Minimization nonexample: In this program, the same goal is accomplished, but instead of few lines, it requires a significant amount more. This makes it more difficult to protect each part of a program that performs exactly the same as it's shorter superior, decreasing security.
