Least Privilage example: In this program we have a basic class holding three variables of different types, and six accessor methods in order for the main program to access these variables. This code is an example of Least Privilage because in order for a user to access the class variables in any way, it must do so through the accessor functions. In seperating the class variables and the main program, the user is not being given the privilage to access class variables, therefor making the program more secure.
Least Privilage Non-Example: In this version of the previous program, the main program is not denied access to the class variables, and is therefor given Privilage to them. Instead of the program passing the private values of the class object through public functions, the main program is given direct access to previously private variables, making the program less secure.
