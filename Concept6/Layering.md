Layering example: In this program, we have a password protection simulation using three layers of protection. A password, a pin code, and a pattern are required to be granted access. This increases security because if one of the layers is penetrated, then there are more in the way of granted permissions, increasing security.

Layering nonexample: In this program, there is only one layer of protection. If the one password required is somehow bypassed, then access is automatically granted. This is much less secure than it's equal with three layers.
