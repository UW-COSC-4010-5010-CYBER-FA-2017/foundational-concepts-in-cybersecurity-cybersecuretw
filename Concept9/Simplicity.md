Simplicity example: In this program we have a simple Hello World program. It is very short, not overly complex. Because of this programs simplicity, it will be easily edited and updated in the future, allowing for a more secure program. 

Simplicity nonexample: In this Hello World program, the code is clearly (and severely) overly complicated. It takes a class, class function, vector, and a loop to complete a simple task. Upon reading, it is much more likely that a programmer will make a mistake than with the simple code, therefor making this code much less secure.
