Foundational Principles of Cybersecurity  

This repository will hold branches for each of the ten Foundational Principles of Cybersecurtiy. Each branch will include an example
program, a non-example program, a picture/gif as an example of that concept, and a file explaining each example/non-example.   
The ten concepts are as follows:   
  
  1)Domain Seperation: The seperation of domains in order to increase security.  
  2)Process Isolation: The seperation of memory/operations/processes in order to increase security.  
  3)Resource Encapsulation: The seperation of resources to assure they are only used in the way intended by the creater.   
  4)Least Privilege: The lack of unnecesary privilages in users/objects/etc in order to prevent non-privilaged users/programs from accessing privilaged data.  
  5)Modularity: The breaking up of a program into pieces, allowing each piece to be a seperate piece of the program, but still work in unison.   
  6)Layering: The layering of protocols in order to create multiple levels of security.
  7)Abstraction: The representing of an object in an abstract way. Allows for increased security by being less open about details surrounding objects.  
  8)Data Hiding: Hiding data in order to allow access only to what is completely necessary, increasing security through less easily discovered details.   
  9)Simplicity: The simplification of a programs allows for easier interpretation of said program, leading to easily applied security.  
  10)Minimization: The shortenning of a program in order to minimize the size of a possible target of an attack.
