Foundational Principles of Cybersecurity  

This repository will hold branches for each of the ten Foundational Principles of Cybersecurtiy. Each branch will include an example
program, a non-example program, a picture/gif as an example of that concept, and a file explaining each example/non-example.   
The ten concepts are as follows:   
  
  1)Domain Separation: The separation of domains to increase security.  
  2)Process Isolation: The separation of memory/operations/processes to increase security.  
  3)Resource Encapsulation: The separation of resources to assure they are only used in the way intended by the creator.   
  4)Least Privilege: The lack of unnecessary privileges in users/objects/etc in order to prevent non-privileged users/programs from accessing privileged data.  
  5)Modularity: The breaking up of a program into pieces, allowing each piece to be a separate piece of the program, but still work in unison.   
  6)Layering: The layering of protocols to create multiple levels of security.
  7)Abstraction: The representing of an object in an abstract way. Allows for increased security by being less open about details surrounding objects.  
  8)Data Hiding: Hiding data to allow access only to what is completely necessary, increasing security through less easily discovered details.   
  9)Simplicity: The simplification of a program allows for easier interpretation of said program, leading to easily applied security.  
  10)Minimization: The shortening of a program to minimize the size of a possible target of an attack.
